📌 Project Description

Resume–Job Matching using NLP & Cosine Similarity

This project implements an AI-driven Resume–Job Matching System that evaluates how well a resume aligns with a given job description. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization, text preprocessing, and cosine similarity, the model computes a match score (%) between resumes and job postings.

🔑 Key Features

Preprocessing of resumes & job descriptions (stopword removal, lemmatization, normalization).

Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Match score calculation using Cosine Similarity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

Saves a processed dataset with computed match scores.

Easy to extend into a predictive ML model for real-world ATS systems.

🎯 Use Case

Helps recruiters quickly identify best-fit candidates.

Assists job seekers in tailoring resumes to job postings.

Forms the basis for building an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).

🚀 Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, nltk, seaborn, matplotlib)

NLP (TF-IDF, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal)

Cosine Similarity for scoring

give me the best readme it should have all the details in the project if anyone sees it they should not get any doubt for asking what have you used why used what have you implemented pricisly the whole project should be in readme

📄 Resume–Job Matching using NLP & Cosine Similarity
📌 Overview

This project is an AI-powered Resume–Job Matching System that analyzes how well a resume matches a given job description.
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Cosine Similarity, it computes a match score (%) to help recruiters shortlist candidates faster and job seekers optimize their resumes.

The project can be extended into a full Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for real-world hiring workflows.

🎯 Motivation

Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes per job posting and manually screening them is time-consuming.
Similarly, job seekers struggle to know whether their resume aligns with the job description.

This project solves both problems by:
✅ Automatically scoring resumes against job descriptions.
✅ Identifying strengths and weaknesses in resumes.
✅ Saving time in recruitment and job applications.

🚀 Features

Resume & Job Description Preprocessing

Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, lemmatization.

Feature Extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Similarity Calculation with Cosine Similarity.

Match Score (%) computed for each Resume–Job pair.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization plots.

CSV Export of match results (e.g., candidate name, score, job role).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy → Data manipulation

sklearn → TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity

nltk → Text preprocessing (stopwords, lemmatization)

matplotlib, seaborn → Data visualization

⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing

Clean text (remove special characters, punctuation, lowercase).

Remove stopwords (using NLTK).

Lemmatize words to reduce them to root form.

2. Feature Extraction

Apply TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical vectors.

3. Similarity Scoring

Use Cosine Similarity to calculate the angle between resume and job description vectors.

Generate a match score (0–100%).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of match scores across candidates.

Visualizations using bar plots, histograms, heatmaps.

5. Output

A structured CSV file with:

Candidate Name | Job Role | Match Score (%)


Graphs showing insights from the dataset.


📊 Example Output

Sample Match Result (CSV export):

Candidate	Job Role	Match Score (%)
John Doe	Data Analyst	78.4
Alice Ray	Data Scientist	65.2
Mark Lee	Business Analyst	82.7

Visualization Example:

Histogram of similarity scores

Heatmap showing candidate vs job matches


📌 Future Improvements

✅ Integration with LLMs (ChatGPT, BERT, RoBERTa) for deeper semantic matching.

✅ Web application interface (Flask/Django).

✅ Resume feedback system for job seekers.

✅ Ranking system to shortlist top candidates.
